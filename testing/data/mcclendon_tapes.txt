okay so um we were talkin about that time granddaddy slipped behind the stove yeah that was in the summer cause i remember it was hot like real hot like stick to your chair hot and theo you ran in from the backyard right you had them muddy boots and mama yelled not in my kitchen boy but you didn’t even hear her cause you saw him on the floor

yeah he was just layin there and the pot was still boilin that’s the part that scared me the most like he fell but the food just kept going like nothing happened

that was when i had just started at grady hospital i remember because i was still learnin the routes and i got stuck on the 26 line for like twenty minutes tryin to get to decatur and i was wearin them white nurse shoes that always squeaked

mm-hmm i remember that pot roast smell was all through the house that day even after the ambulance came and they rolled him out you could still smell rosemary on the curtains

y’all remember big sarah though his mama that woman didn’t take no nonsense twelve kids raised all of em in that little blue house on old mill road no insulation just quilts and wood stove heat

i ain’t never seen a woman carry a basket of laundry on her head and smoke a pipe at the same time but big sarah did and she whupped theo with a shoe once cause he called her biscuits dusty

well they was dusty

that’s cause they used cornmeal not flour back then save the flour for birthdays and funerals

i think granddaddy was born in that house wasn’t no hospital back then just midwives and aunt louise with the bucket of warm water

they didn’t get no birth certificate till he was tryna get on with the navy and reverend james had to write a letter sayin he knew him since he was knee-high

that’s right that’s how he got that job fixing radios for the post office cause they didn’t care if you had a diploma long as you could fix the static

he used to tell me every machine got a song you just gotta tune your ear

i still remember the sound of that old philco radio buzzin before the baseball game came on

oh lawd and his suit y’all remember the blue one the one he wore to every funeral and every wedding and even to that one choir performance i got a picture of it somewhere

wasn’t that the one from buster brown’s on auburn ave

yup and the lady who sold it to him had that big mole on her cheek and she always wore orange lipstick she told him the suit was made of “spirit fabric”

i don’t even know what that means but he wore that thing until it got shiny on the elbows

remember when he taught me how to change a tire on the chevy out front in the driveway with nothin but a brick and a wrench that didn’t fit

and he ain’t even have a license did he

nope just a learner’s permit from 1961 and it was laminated like someone ironed it

but he got us to sunday school every week with that busted muffler draggin behind like a tail

i got my first job at rich’s cleanin up after the perfume ladies they used to give me the little paper tester strips for free and i’d wear ‘em like earrings

i swear we need to put all this on a tape or somethin before it fades you know i mean who’s gonna remember that grandma made dandelion wine in mason jars and hid em behind the hymnals

or that auntie ruth tried to get a job at the radio station by pretending she was from connecticut

she said her name was janice but spelled it with a g like gnashis or some mess

*laughter*

these stories they all got fingerprints on em like hand-me-downs you keep wearin even after the tag’s faded

i ain’t sayin write a book but like maybe just a box y’know a box full of people and sounds and dates that nobody but us would understand but still worth keepin
